## 1.3.0
* New features
	* Multi-lang support(There are Turkish and English for now, but you can add your own language as "resources/langs/yourlanguage.json". Also, if you added a new language, you can contribute to me by opening a pull request.)
	* Discord Webhook system added for logging trolls.
    * I didn't add new "trolls" because I got lazy, and I'm studying for the university entrance exam.
